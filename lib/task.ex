  Conveniences for spawning and awaiting for tasks.

  Tasks are processes that meant to execute one particular
  action throughout their life-cycle, often with little
  explicit communication with other processes. The most common
  use case for tasks is to compute a value asynchronously:

      task = Task.async(fn -> do_some_work() end)
      res  = do_some_other_work()
      res + Task.await(task)

  Tasks spawned with async can be awaited on by its caller
  process (and only its caller) as shown in the example above.
  They are implemented by spawning a process that sends a message
  to the caller once the given computation is performed.

  Besides `async/1` and `await/1`, tasks can also be used as part
  of supervision trees and dynamically spawned in remote nodes.
  We will explore all three scenarios next.

  ## async and await

  The most common way to spawn a task is with `Task.async/1`. A new
  process will be created and this process is linked and monitored
  by the caller. However, the processes are unlinked right before
  the task finishes, allowing the proper error to be triggered only
  on `await/1`.

  This implies three things:

  1) In case the caller crashes, the task will be killed and its
     computation will abort;

  2) In case the task crashes due to an error, the parent will
     crash only on `await/1`;

  3) In case the task crashes because a linked process caused
     it to crash, the parent will crash immediately;

  ## Supervised tasks

  It is also possible to spawn a task inside a supervision tree
  with `start_link/1` and `start_link/3`:

      Task.start_link(fn -> IO.puts "ok" end)

  Such can be mounted in your supervision tree as:

      import Supervisor.Spec

      children = [
        worker(Task, [fn -> IO.puts "ok" end])
      ]

  Since such tasks are supervised and not directly linked to
  the caller, they cannot be awaited on. For such reason,
  differently from `async/1`, `start_link/1` returns `{ :ok, pid }`
  (which is the result expected by supervision trees).

  Such tasks are useful as workers that run during your application
  life-cycle and rarely communicate with other workers. For example,
  a worker that pushes data to another server or a worker that consumes
  events from an event manager and writes it to a log file.

  ## Supervision trees

  The `Task.Sup` module allows developers to start supervisors
  that dynamically supervise tasks:

      { :ok, pid } = Task.Sup.start_link()
      Task.Sup.async(pid, fn -> do_work() end)

  `Task.Sup` also makes it possible to spawn tasks in remote nodes as
  long as the supervisor is registered locally or globally:

      # In the remote node
      Task.Sup.start_link(local: :tasks_sup)

      # On the client
      Task.Sup.async({ :tasks_sup, :remote@local }, fn -> do_work() end)

  `Task.Sup` is more often started in your supervision tree as:

      import Supervisor.Spec

      children = [
        supervisor(Task.Sup, [[local: :tasks_sup]])
      ]

  Check `Task.Sup` for other operations supported by the Task supervisor.
